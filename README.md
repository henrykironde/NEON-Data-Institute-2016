# NEON-Data-Institute-2016

__Introduction to the NEON Project__


__Pre-Institute Wk 1:__ [Introduction to NEON & Reproducible Science](http://neon-workwithdata.github.io/neon-data-institute-2016/tutorial-series/pre-institute1/intro-to-neon)

Learning Objectives

At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

- [ ] Explain the mission of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).
- [ ] Explain the how sites are located within the NEON project design.
- [ ] Explain the different types of data that will be collected and provided by NEON.

Week 1 Culmination Activity

Write up a brief summary of a project that you might want to explore while at the Data Institute in Boulder, CO. Include the types of NEON (and other data) that you will need to implement this project. Save this summary as you will be refining and adding to your ideas over the next few weeks.

The goal of this activity if for you to begin to think about the project that you wish to work on while at the Data Institute. This project will ideally be performed in groups, so over the next few weeks youâ€™ll have a chance to view the other project proposals and merge projects to collaborate with your colleagues.

Remote sensing and forecasting :)
